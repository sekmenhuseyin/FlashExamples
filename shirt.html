<!--Start with a rectangle that is not a square:  a full-size newspaper works well.The Captain's Shirta model taught to me by Lillian Oppenheimer who told the story to my son, Daniel.Fold the paper in half, short side to short sideFolding down...Folded in half.Fold corners to center.Folding corners in....Fold up one flap in two stepsFolding up front flap...Folding up the folded flap just made.Folding up the folded flap just made...Repeat on the back flap: flip over and then fold up.Model flipped over. Fold flap up in two steps.Repeating on the back flap: fold first step....Repeating on the back flap: fold second step: fold up flap just made.Both flaps up.  Model is starting to loop like a hat. Fold and tuck front corners underneath back and then fold over back cornersFront flaps marked for 'mountain' fold.Front flaps folded in...Back flaps folded to the front...Now it is time to put the hat on (someone)This is the Captain's hat.  Take it off the captain.Now make a pirate's hat. First, grab the front and back at the bottom of the hat, pull apart and then collapse into a square diamond shape.Square.  (NOT TO SCALE)Now make a pirate's hat by folding up to make a triangle in the front and backFolding up in front....Front folded up.Fold up in back.Back folded up. This is a pirate's hat.Repeat the same step of collapsing into a square.Changed to square.Grab outside pieces and pull apartpulling apart....A boat!Now what happens to the boat?The boat sails in rough waters...The waters were so rough.......that the stern of the boat broke off.... (rip off one corner)then the front of the boat broke off  (rip off other corner)both front and back (prow and stern?) off.Then the top of the mast came off (rip off the point)poor boat.... (now unfold all but the very last, the first fold you did.)... nothing left but the captain's shirt....--><OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"
