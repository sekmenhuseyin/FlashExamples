<ul>
  <li><b><i>Programming Games</i></b>: Repeating the course first
offered Spring, 2003, we will be building simple games (take links indicated above to see examples of games), programming in
JavaScript and Flash's ActionScript. The goal of the course is to teach
basic programming skills, with the focus on event-driven programming,
attention to user interface, and logic, using the problem domain of
games. Students create their own games after completing the set assignments.
    </li>
  <li><b><i>Communicating Quantitative Information</i></b>: This
is a repeat running of a course satisfying the general education
mathematics/quantitative reasoning (Core V) requirement.  The goal is to
teach the concepts necessary to understand topics commonly in the news
through in-class and on-line discussion of the news stories (for example, crime statistics,
polling, testing, stocks and bonds), paper and presentation assignments, exercises and quizzes. Take links indicated above for lecture charts and schedule and read below for
papers and presentations based on experiences with this course.

In this new course, students will focus on computer interfaces that
provide practical functions, serving specific audiences. We will study
methods for evaluating interfaces and assessing usability. Technologies
include XML, XSLT, WML, and VoiceXML. The choices for projects include
kiosks, web pages, bilingual web pages, web-enabled wireless phones,
Web sites for visually impaired, and regular phone (making use of
Tellme studio). <a
